# Coronavirus twitter analysis
From dataset of tweets in 2020, we partition our data into an observation of each day. Then, we map data of an observation with our hashtags and collect the language of that observation. After that, we reduce(or sum up) the result into for the language and the location of where tweets were tweeted.
The result shows that in 2020, most tweets with english hashtags relating to the covid-19 are in english. Moreover, most tweets with hashtags in other languages such as chinese, korean, and japanese which are also relating to the covid-19 are in the same languge with the hashtag. Note that the result is not surprising as we expect that people are most likely to use hashtags with the same language that they tweet. Furthermore, a caveat of this analysis is double counting. For example, the hash tags which contain 'coronavirus' also contain 'corona' which makes the number of tweets with hashtag 'corona' is bigger than of 'coronavirus'
